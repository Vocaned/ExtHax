# ExtHax
External ClassiCube proxy between the client and the server, useful for many shady things

# NOTE: Even though the program is called ExtHax, ultimately its main purpose is to act as a debugging tool. I do not condone the use of this program for hacking on public servers, and do not provide required modules that would allow you to bypass server restrictions. I will not provide support if you plan on using the program for cheating.

how 2 use:
  1. modify config.py
  2. get plugins somewhere
  3. run main.py, log in, join server
  4. do productive stuff like packet sniffing for debugging
